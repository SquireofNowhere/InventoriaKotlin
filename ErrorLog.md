# 🛠️ Inventoria Error Log & Resolution History

This document tracks significant bugs encountered during development and the technical solutions implemented to resolve them.

## 🐞 1. Task Desync During Rapid Operations
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### 📝 Problem
Starting and stopping a task segment in rapid succession (under 1 second) caused multiple devices to desync. One device would show the task stopped, while others would show it still running or "ghost" restarted.

### 🔍 Root Cause
- **Clock Precision**: `System.currentTimeMillis()` can return the same value for operations happening in the same millisecond. Sync logic cannot order these correctly.
- **Atomic Split**: The "Stop Task" action involved two separate database calls (Complete Task + End Session), creating a race condition window.

### 🛠️ Final Fix
- **Monotonic Timestamps**: Implemented a monotonic counter in `TaskRepository.kt` that guarantees a strictly increasing `updatedAt` value for every operation, even if they occur in the same millisecond.
- **Atomic Transactions**: Created a `@Transaction` method `stopTaskAndSession` in `TaskDao` to ensure both state changes are committed as a single unit.

## 🐞 2. Link Persistence & "Zombie" Data
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### 📝 Problem
Removing links between items would work locally, but the links would reappear after an app restart or a cloud sync.

### 🔍 Root Cause
- **Merging vs Overwriting**: The sync engine used `updateChildren` when pushing to Firebase. This merged local lists with cloud data, making deletions impossible (the cloud would just add the "missing" link back to the local device).

### 🛠️ Final Fix
- **Full State Overwrite**: Switched to `setValue()` for all sync nodes in `FirebaseSyncRepository.kt`. This ensures that if a link is deleted locally, it is removed from the cloud, and subsequently from all other devices.

## 🐞 3. Disappearing Items & Self-Parenting Loops
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### 📝 Problem
Certain items (like a "Bag") would disappear from the inventory list, and opening their details would crash the app.

### 🔍 Root Cause
- **Logical Circularity**: An item was set as its own physical parent (`parentId == id`). This caused the recursive location resolver and hierarchy builder to enter an infinite loop.

### 🛠️ Final Fix
- **Sanitization Guard**: Added repository-level protection in `InventoryRepository.kt` that forces `parentId` to `null` if an item tries to parent itself.
- **Recursion Ticker**: Added a `visited` set to all recursive functions in the ViewModels and Repository to safely break out of any loops caused by "bad" data in the database.

## 🐞 4. Drag-and-Drop Ejection
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### 📝 Problem
Dragging an item that was part of a linked group out of a container would sometimes "eject" it into root space while its linked followers stayed in the container, or vice versa.

### 🔍 Root Cause
- **Follower Application**: The drag-and-drop handler was only updating the `parentId` of the specific item being dragged, ignoring its logical followers.

### 🛠️ Final Fix
- **Recursive Move**: Updated `moveItem` in `InventoryListViewModel.kt` to explicitly request a follower update (`applyToFollowers = true`). Now, moving a leader item physically moves the entire logical group.

## 🐞 5. Multi-Device "Sync-Back" Race Condition
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### 📝 Problem
Actions on Device A would briefly reflect on Device B, but then Device B would "sync back" its old state, overriding the new change.

### 🔍 Root Cause
- **Sync Echo**: Device B would apply a cloud change, which would trigger a local database observer, which Device B would then mistake for a "new local change" and push back to the cloud.

### 🛠️ Final Fix
- **Atomic Ignore Counter**: Replaced the boolean sync guard with an `AtomicInteger`. When a cloud update starts, the counter increments; local changes are ignored until the counter returns to zero.
- **Flow Throttling**: Used `collectLatest` on the Firebase listener to ensure only the absolute latest cloud state is processed, canceling any overlapping stale pulls.
